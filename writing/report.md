# CMPSC 302 Final Report

Please respond to the following prompts.

## Was your project a success? Describe why or why not.

`: Respond to above prompt.`

I would say my project was successful. I learned so many things about Web3 objects, metamask, javascript functions, css styling, and CONTRACTS! It was an amazing experience because at the start of this project, I was not confident in myself and did not know how and what to do in my final project. I did not want to choose a web3 project because I knew nothing of it. I was lost. However, after countless ideas, countless trials and error, I was finally able to deliver my final product all thanks to my effort and my professor Luman!

One thing that I am kind of disappointed about was that I wanted to learn how to generate a contract and publish it in the web. Professor Luman was kind enough to write and publish a contract similar to the King of the Hill game for my project. However, I can always research and do projects on my own.

## What surprising skills did you learn as part of developing the project?

`: Respond to above prompt.`

A surprising skill I learned was being able to read javascript and its web3 module. At first, I could not understand a single script line that uses the contract and the web3 module. However, my resiliency and just looking at the code everyday and doing my own research made it easy for me to understand and learn more new stuff. 

For that previous reason, I am proud of myself for understanding a dependency and what it does. I think this an important skill that every software developer should have - being able to understand what the module you imported does.

## Reflect on the areas where you believe you've demonstrated the most strength/knowledge.

`: Respond to above prompt.`

I think I demonstrated my most strength when it comes to implemingting the event listeners and the functions. This is because, I had no clue how functions are written in javascript and how event listeners work with the HTML. However, I am surprised that I was able to overcome the adversities and started writing some javascript functions that did some stuff locally and also with the CONTRACT!

## How does completing this project further your professional or academic goals?

`: Respond to above prompt.`

I think project was a small step for me and will definitely help me learn more information in the future. Because I learned a new module 'WEB3' and how contracts are written and worked. In the future, I would like to work on a project that deals with real ETH, serve an actual purpose and is a real product. 

For academic goals, I think this project proves that no matter what computer science I face, I will be resilient and overcome it. This project and the software engineering course were a huge confidence booster for me. I did not know I had it in me. 

## From the syllabus, choose at least `2` learning objectives you achieved, and describe how below.

`: Learning objective 1`

- Express basic fluency in HTML5, CSS, Javscript, and nodeJS markup/programming languages

When I first started, I did not know about the DOM, CSS, and Javascript. I kind of knew how to write logic on javascript because of Leetcode, but had 0 experience when it comes to combining HTML and Javascript. I have to admit that javascript was not an easy language to learn. It was not as easy as python. 

However, I started implementing and experimenting little things on my own, and I slowly started to learn things one at a time. Now, I am confident enough to tell that I know HTML, CSS, JS, and solidity in an intermadiate level.

`: Learning objective 2`
- Understand and deploy strategies which build accessible and responsive web content

I never realized how CSS, HTML, and JS worked really close with one another. It is also so easy to call variables from the other module written in a different language. I also liked the way that the course was scheduled in a way that we learned HTML and CSS first and tackled the hardest one JS after.
