# CMPSC 302 Project Description

Please fill out the areas below.

## Description

`: Provide a brief description of the project you're extending or attempting`

I would like to extend both my cake website and the a simon game or a game that is similar to the simon game at least. Building on these two, I also would like to try out the fake ETH transaction thing. I will also add more features from Professor Luman's game that changes status.

## Areas of development

```
: Write a short paragraph (or two) detailing the areas of the project that you:

* Know well
* Need to develop more competency/skills in
* Would like to learn if new to you (i.e. we haven't covered them directly in class)
```

I think I would say I am good at knowing the overall structure of the HTML DOM and working with CSS. The things that I kind of lack at the moment is my javascript because the things we covered in class were super advanced for me but I am not letting that stop me from implementing more stuff with javascript.

Moreover, the thing I would like to learn the most is mastering javascript and the thing with the meta mask. I would like to create a website that can take the fake ETH and make changes on that website.

## Challenges

```
: Detail at least three major challenges that you believe you will encouter
in the process of implementing this project
```
- I do not know anything about crypto currency and its web transactions. Set up might be hard.

- Writing some advanced code in javascript. creating objects and event listeners for example.

- Creating an aesthetically pleasing website. I feel like coding from scratch can be hard if you really want a good looking website.

## Ideal outcome

```
: Detail what a completely successful outcome for this project might look like --
what would make completing this project worth it?
```

Success would not define my final work. However, it will reflect what I learned during the process. I really want to learn about web3 crypto thing. I want to keep up with the modern trend because I will become a software engineer.
