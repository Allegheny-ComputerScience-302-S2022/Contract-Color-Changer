# CMPSC 302 Project Update

Please provide responses to the following questions.

## Describe the progress you've made toward completing your project.

`: Respond to above prompt.`

Last week when I was writing my project description, I was unsure what to do. I was ambivalent between choosing web3 project and a portfolio done with static tools and react. However, seeing the global trend with the block-chain technology and decentralized transactions, I decided to try a web3 project.

Professor Luman and I discussed potential web3 projects, and we came up with something simple. A webpage that will collect ETH and change the color of the elements in the webpage. This may seem like a simple project, but it has a powerful and complex functionality behind it! 

## What areas are still challenging? What are some unforeseen issues that have arisen?

`: Respond to above prompt.`

First of all, I did not what was web3. I did not know what's its used for, what's its purpose is, and most importantly how its used. However, I am did some research on web3 and I found out that web3 is a very useful technology and is currently in its development stage.

Secondly, web3 and metamask need a "contract" to be written. The contract is written in a language called solidary and it kind of seems like it is a mix between java and javascript. Therefore, I need to learn the contract language in order to write my contract and to implement my transaction feature.

Lastly, I think the most challenging part is writing the javascript that uses web3, css, and html elements. I am not that experienced when it comes to script language, but, nonetheless, I will try my best.

## Detail one success that you've achieved.

`: Respond to above prompt.`

So far, I implemented the most stuff in the HTML. For example, the color input and the layout. Moreover, I styled them too. Now, I am working on the event listeners and the function that retrieves the color and does some change to the webpage with the inputed color.

## In what, if any, areas would you like additional assistance?

`: Respond to above prompt`

I would like to know more about the block-chain technology and NFTs. I know it is pretty hyped but at the moment, but it would not hurt to know the present trend.

Other than this, I would like to get good at javascript and of course the solidarry language that is used to write the contract.
